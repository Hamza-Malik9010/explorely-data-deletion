    <h2>What Happens When You Delete Your Data</h2>
    <p>When your data deletion request is processed, we will remove or anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be used to identify you. This may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account details (username, email address, profile information)</li>
        <li>Your travel histories, preferences, and reviews</li>
        <li>Any other personally identifiable information associated with your Explorely account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please be aware that certain non-personal information or aggregated data (which cannot identify you) may be retained for analytical, security, or legal compliance purposes.</p>

    <h2>Revoking Deletion Requests</h2>
    <p>If you change your mind before the deletion is finalized, you may contact us to cancel the request. After your data is deleted, the process cannot be reversed, and your information will be permanently removed.</p>
